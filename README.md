# Unity Parable
This is our project submission for the Introduction to Unity course in 2021.<br>
You can find the project in two relevant branches.<br>
The first branch "parable-code" contains our adaptation of BoulderDash. In this game you have to collect all 12 gems on the map and avoid enemys to get a secret code.<br> It was planned that you would need this code to unlock the 3d levels of the game - kind of progressing from 2d to 3d.<br>
We sadly overestimated the size of the project and couldn't finish our second part of the project - a 3d styled game where you have to utilize movements to overcome objects and get away from a chaser. This project (located in the branch "parable-chaser") was created for the current DeepRL in tandem with the Intro to Unity course as the chaser is a DeepRL agent.<br> The branch "parable-movement" has all the movement and a basic level that can demonstrate the current state of the player-movement.
The animations and movement was complexter than we throught it would be (animation timing, raycasts, checks, edge-cases and more raycasts) so this part of the project is not finished yet but we will strive to complete it towards the deadline of the DeepRL course and after it too :)<br>

<h2>2d controls / BoulderDash</h2>
Arrow keys to move

<h2>3d controls / runner</h2>
While BoulderDash should be self-explaining, it might not be the case for the 3d-runner game. <br> Here you currently can: <br>
W to walk <br>
W+Shift to run <br>
Space to jump (only when not running or walking) <br>
Space in front of a climbable wall will grab onto  the wall <br>
Space while grabbed onto a wall will pull you ontop the wall <br>
(more to be implemented) <br>
<br>

aaand most important: Theres also a hidden Macarena Dance animation!
